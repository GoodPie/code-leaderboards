# Implementation Plan: Visually Appealing Landing Page

**Branch**: `001-we-want-to` | **Date**: 2025-09-10 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-we-want-to/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set cision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

This feature will create a visually appealing, generic landing page for programming meetup groups. The page will provide
a clear path for users to log in, and will not include a registration feature. The technical approach will involve
creating a new route, controller, and view in the Rails application, styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Ruby 3.4.2
**Primary Dependencies**: Rails 8.x, Tailwind CSS v4
**Storage**: N/A (for this feature)
**Testing**: RSpec, Capybara
**Target Platform**: Web
**Project Type**: Web Application
**Performance Goals**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there specific performance goals for this page, e.g., load time?]
**Constraints**:

- The application is invite-only, so no registration page should be accessible.
- Remove references to Ruby specifically. Although this will be used initially in a ruby meetup, the aim is for it to be
  used for whatever prorgramming meetup group
  **Scale/Scope**: A single landing page.

- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? Yes
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas? N/A
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase. Yes
- For Rails projects: prefer factory_bot factories over fixtures for new tests. Yes

**Contracts (Public Interfaces)**:

- Input/output schemas defined and validated? N/A
- Failure modes and side effects documented? N/A
- Simple CLI or rake task for black-box testing provided? N/A
- Backwards compatibility not required (greenfield), but document deprecations if any process changes. Yes

**Observability**:

- Structured logging included? Yes
- Frontend logs → backend? Yes
- Error context sufficient? Yes

**Versioning**:

- Version number assigned? N/A
- BUILD increments on every change? N/A
- Breaking changes handled? N/A

**Structure Decision**: Option 2: Web application

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
    - Research best practices for creating visually appealing, generic landing pages for tech meetups.
    - Determine performance goals for the landing page.

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
    - Decision: [what was chosen]
    - Rationale: [why chosen]
    - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
    - No new entities for this feature.

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
    - No new APIs for this feature.

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
    - No new contract tests for this feature.

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
    - Each story → integration test scenario
    - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
    - Run `/scripts/update-agent-context.sh [claude|gemini|copilot]` for your AI assistant
    - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
    - Preserve manual additions between markers
    - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
    - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
    - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Create a new route for the landing page.
- Create a new controller and action for the landing page.
- Create a new view for the landing page.
- Style the landing page with Tailwind CSS.
- Add a system test to verify the landing page content and functionality.

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Route -> Controller -> View -> System Test

**Estimated Output**: 5-7 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|----------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |

## Progress Tracking

**Phase Status**:

- [X] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [X] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [X] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
