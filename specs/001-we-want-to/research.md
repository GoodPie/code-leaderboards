# Research: Visually Appealing Landing Page

## Visual Elements to Represent a Programming Meetup Group

- **Decision**: The landing page will use a generic and modern design that can be easily customized. It will feature
  abstract programming-related graphics and a neutral color palette that can be adapted to different meetup groups.
- **Rationale**: This approach ensures the landing page is not tied to a specific programming language or community,
  making it reusable for various meetup groups. The focus will be on a clean, professional look that is welcoming to all
  developers.
- **Alternatives considered**: Creating a highly customizable theming system, but this was rejected as overly complex
  for the initial version.

## Performance Goals

- **Decision**: The landing page will have a target load time of under 2 seconds on a standard broadband connection.
- **Rationale**: A fast load time is a critical aspect of good UX and is a standard industry best practice. This ensures
  a positive first impression for visitors.
- **Alternatives considered**: No specific performance goals, but this was rejected as it could lead to a poor user
  experience.
