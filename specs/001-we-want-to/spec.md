# Feature Specification: Visually Appealing Landing Page

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "We want to create a landing page that is visually appealing but also represents a
programming meetup group. It should follow best UX practices and just lead to a login page. We won't have registration
as it's an invite only application."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
    - User types and permissions
    - Data retention/deletion policies
    - Performance targets and scale
    - Error handling behaviors
    - Integration requirements
    - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a visitor to the application, I want to see a visually appealing landing page that represents a programming meetup
group, so that I can understand the purpose of the application and be directed to the login page.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a visitor is on the landing page, **When** they view the page, **Then** they should see a design that is
   visually appealing and related to a programming meetup group.
2. **Given** a visitor is on the landing page, **When** they look for a way to enter the application, **Then** they
   should easily find a link or button to the login page.
3. **Given** a visitor is on the landing page, **When** they look for a registration or sign-up option, **Then** they
   should not find one, as the application is invite-only.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to navigate to a registration page
  directly? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should this redirect to the landing page or show a specific message?]
- How does the page render on different devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST have a publicly accessible landing page.
- **FR-002**: The landing page MUST be visually appealing and reflect a programming meetup
  group. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What specific visual elements or themes should be included to represent a programming meetup group?]
- **FR-003**: The landing page MUST include a clear call-to-action that directs users to the login page.
- **FR-004**: The landing page MUST NOT include a registration or sign-up feature.
- **FR-005**: The landing page MUST be responsive and display correctly on common device screen sizes.
